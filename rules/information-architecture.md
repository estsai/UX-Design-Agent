# Rule: Information Architecture

**Priority:** HIGH
**Category:** Information Architecture

## Description

Information architecture determines how content is structured, labeled, and navigated. If users can't find it, it doesn't exist.

## Navigation Structure

### Core Principles
- Limit primary navigation to 5-7 items
- Use clear, descriptive labels (nouns for sections, verbs for actions)
- Group by user mental models, not org charts
- Provide breadcrumbs for hierarchies deeper than 2 levels
- Users should always know: where am I, where can I go, how do I get back
- Breadth over depth: 7 top-level items beats 3 levels of nesting
- Consistent navigation placement across all pages (spatial memory)
- "Where am I?" should be answerable in 1 second on any screen

### Navigation Patterns
- **Top bar:** Best for 3-7 primary sections on desktop
- **Side nav:** Best for deep hierarchies or tools with many sections
- **Bottom bar:** Best for mobile apps with 3-5 primary actions
- **Hamburger menu:** Use sparingly; hides navigation and reduces discoverability
- **Tabs:** Best for switching between related views at the same level

### Mobile Considerations
- Use bottom navigation for 3-5 primary actions (most reachable)
- Reserve hamburger menus for secondary navigation only
- Highlight the current section in the navigation bar
- Ensure navigation doesn't consume more than 20% of the viewport

## Content Organization

### Organizational Principles
- **User-centric grouping:** Organize by user goals, not business departments
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show only what's needed; reveal details on demand
- **Consistency:** Same type of content in the same location across pages
- **Scannability:** Clear headings, short paragraphs, visual breaks

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Page title:** What is this page about? (one per page)
2. **Section headings:** Major content groups
3. **Supporting content:** Details within each section
4. **Related content:** Cross-links and supplementary information
6. **F-pattern for text-heavy pages:** key info in the first two words of each line
7. **Z-pattern for visual pages:** eye follows top-left to top-right to bottom-left
  to bottom-right
8. **Above the fold:** 50% of viewing time happens above the fold

### Information Scent
- Labels should clearly indicate what users will find
- Every link and button must clearly signal what's behind it
- Preview content where possible (descriptions, thumbnails, counts)
- Use "trigger words" that match user vocabulary
- Provide visual cues for content types (icons for video, PDF, external links)

### Search as Navigation
- Include search for products with more than 50 content items
- Provide autocomplete suggestions based on popular queries
- Show recent searches for returning users

### Design the Flow, Not Just the Screen
- **Happy path:** the ideal journey from start to finish
- **Edge cases:** 0 items? 1,000 items? Long names? Missing data?
- **Error recovery:** every error needs a clear path back to success
- **Empty states:** the first thing new users see -- make it useful, not "no data"
- **Loading states:** skeleton screens (show structure) beat spinners (show nothing)

## Common Mistakes
- Organizing navigation by internal team structure instead of user needs
- Using jargon or branded terminology users don't understand
- Hiding essential navigation behind a hamburger menu on desktop
- Deep nesting requiring more than 3 clicks to reach important content
- Mirroring the database structure in the UI
